# ARES_implementation
An implementation of the ARES -- the RNA tertiary structure prediction scoring function

The paper: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abe5650

Since the author didn't provide the label file and the final checkpoint he used in the paper, so it's difficult to implement the code.

Struggling for weeks, I finally find out how to add labels in lmdb file. I put this code there for reference.

Good luck!



## 2022/4/28 Update: Cannot reproduce the work! Maybe the only thing we can do is wait for the author to open source the label or ckpt.

I have tried to use the label in the pdb, and calculate rmsd using RNA_Puzzles_tool, but never made it.
